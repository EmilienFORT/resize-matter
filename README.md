My entry for the Game Off 2023

# Welcome to the RESIZE MATTER FOUNDATION!
**Resize Matter Foundation** is a very active center for research with more than 400 researchers and doctoral students. 
Our main concern is the world of tomorrow. With over eight billion people on Earth, it is our duty to invest all our resources in the future. And to achieve that, what is the best answer?
Yes, science!

# Size matters
This is the greatest achievement of our leading scientists. Let us introduce you to the first model of the **SCALE GLOVE**. Built from the Moon's rarest materials, this highly conductive glove can scale up and down certain objects (currently those who contain radiolithium). With more time and efforts, I want you to imagine how many applications the Scale Glove will have in the future. Can you count them all? Of course you cannot! Applications are infinite! Clearly, this project is a *glove* letter to science.

# Radiolithium killed the video star
"But what about the radiolithium?" we hear you ask. This metallic green material is one of the biggest mysteries of human history. Too little is known about it, except it shapes itself in a cubic system and its property can change size. Unlike what its name might suggest, it emits no radioactivity. This means it could be introduced into daily life without any problems. Our best scientists are working on a new material involving resin and radiolithium. This way, we could 3D print what we want, and size it the way we need. 

# The future is too big to scale
**Resize Matter Foundation** has a large-scale project (pun intended). We want our world to be better. We want our world to be bigger. And to achieve that, we choose science.
